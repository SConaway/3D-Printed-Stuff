AA and AAA Battery Holders (4, 8, 12, 16 packs) by mistertech is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

# Summary

Here is a set of AA and AAA battery holders. No support needed. These holders have retention so your batteries will not slide out. Handy if you want to toss a pack in a bag and go.

It took 2 hours for me to print the 4AA pack at 0.3MM resolution with 20% infill.


# Print Settings

Printer: FLUX 3D Delta
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.3mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
0.2mm or 0.1mm will require a little less sanding of the retention "bump" if you happen to get any marks on your AA batteries.

# Post-Printing

## Light Sanding of retention "bump" optional

A little light sanding of the retention "bump" at the top of the holder will eliminate any marking that might occur on the batteries. Printing at a finer resolution will reduce the amount of sanding required if any.
